Logic:
Add up the values of the cards
Display value?
Face Cards are worth 10
Aces are 1 or 11
Numbered cards are 2-10
Highest value wins
Compare player to dealer values
Player can hit or stay
Face Down card is assumed to be 10
Dealer value is the face up card plus 10
An ace and something worth 10 is an automatic blackjack
If your value is over 21 then you bust.
Once the player has finished playing, the face down card is flipped.
Dealer stands on 17 and hits on 16 or lower.
Splitting pairs: Any pair can be turned into 2 separate hands and you will be required to re-bet on the second hand.
Doubling down: If the original 2 cards are a sum of 9,10,11. You can double your bet, get one face down card.
If the player busts, the dealer does not have to continue
